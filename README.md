Together, the Dog and Kennel classes form a program that allows users to manage and calculate statistics for multiple dogs in a kennel.

The Dog class represents a dog object with properties such as weight and name. It provides methods to retrieve and modify these properties, as well as methods to convert the weight from pounds to kilograms and get a string representation of the dog object.

The Kennel class serves as a container for multiple Dog objects. It allows users to add information for two dogs, including their names and weights, and calculates the average weight of the dogs in kilograms. It also provides a method to print the information of the dogs and the average weight.

By utilizing the Dog and Kennel classes together, the program allows users to input and manage dog data in a kennel, perform weight conversions, and display relevant statistics.
